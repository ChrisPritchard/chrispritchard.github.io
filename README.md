*Note: I no longer run this company, so this is sort of archived now - I should probably replace it with a portfolio site or something...........*

Github pages site for me/Aquinas IT (my company). Accessible via ~https://aquinas.nz~ https://chrispritchard.github.io.

For those interested, there is a small piece of F# in here, in [devserver.fs](./devserver.fs) that uses a tiny bit of code to create a local static file webserver. This was used for development.
