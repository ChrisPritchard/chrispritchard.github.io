        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p><b>Hello!</b>, My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I presently work as the Lead Security Engineer at <a href="https://www.fluxfederation.com/">Flux Federation</a> 
            in Wellington, Aotearoa / New Zealand.</p>
            <p>I spent about fifteen years working in Software Development, primarily in the .NET
            and HTML5/web space. During this time I had roles ranging from senior developer through to technical lead and solutions architect.</p>
            <p>A few years ago I transitioned to a new career in Information Security, working primarily in application security
            (the improvement of software development efforts from a security standpoint). I work with developers to improve their efforts,
            and I have both designed and led secure development training courses.</p>
            <p>Always looking for new and interesting things to learn and do, and I am happy to help if people have questions about any of the above. <br/>Just reach out!</p>
